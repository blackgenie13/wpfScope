# wpfScope

A clone of some [xScope](http://iconfactory.com/software/xscope) functionality for Windows written in C# using WPF.

## Running

### Requirements

As long as you have .NET Framework 4.5 on either Windows 7 or Windows 8, you should be good to go.

### Usage

Open up wpfScope.exe and make the window large enough to fit all the visual elements you want to measure.

### Known Issues

#### Windows 8

 + The main window is borderless, so to resize, you have to use the top-left hand corner grip.
 + Guidelines flicker.

#### All Versions

 + If the window is maximized, NOTHING WORKS ANYMORE!!!

## Building

### Requirements

Built using:

 + .NET Framework 4.5 with
 + Visual Studio 2012

so you'll probably need those two.

### Usage

Clone the repo, open the wpfScope.sln and choose the right configuration depending on if you are building on  Windows 7 or Windows 8.
